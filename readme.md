# Credit Score Movement Prediction
This project simulates a realistic financial dataset and builds a machine learning model to predict credit score movement (increase, decrease, or stable) based on a variety of customer financial behaviors. It also incorporates model explainability tools like <code>SHAP</code> to interpret model decisions.

## üìå Objective
- Simulate a customer-level dataset with features related to income, credit behavior, and loan history.

- Train a multi-class classification model to predict the movement of credit scores.

- Handle class imbalance using resampling techniques.

- Use model explainability tools to highlight key drivers of predictions.

- Visualize insights and explore data using various EDA techniques.

### Labeling Logic
The credit score movement is determined based on a heuristic involving DPD, credit utilization, EMI-to-income ratio, inquiries, and repayment score.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution plots of target classes.

- Scatter plots of financial variables.

- Violin plots to visualize feature distributions across classes.

- Heatmap to analyze the interaction between gender and credit movement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modeling Approach
### Preprocessing:

- Label encoding for categorical features (gender, location).

- Balanced the dataset using upsampling for minority classes.

### Model:

- Trained a Random Forest Classifier.

- Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.

## üß† Model Explainability
### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
Global explanation method to understand feature importance across the test set. Uses TreeExplainer for interpreting the Random Forest model.

#### Key Insights:
üîπ `dpd_last_3_months` is the most influential feature, strongly contributing to Class 0 (credit score decrease), but also affects all classes.

üî∏ Other top contributors include:

`repayment_history_score`

`num_hard_inquiries_last_6m`

`monthly_emi_outflow`

`credit_utilization_ratio`

üîª Features like `gender`, `num_open_loans`, and `current_outstanding` have minimal impact on predictions and could potentially be dropped or deprioritized.

## Segment Based Interventions

| Segment              | Indicators (SHAP)                        | Risks/Opportunities   | Suggested Actions                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **High-Risk**        | High `dpd`, high `inquiries`, high `emi` | Default, churn        | Payment plans, freeze rules, alerts |
| **High-Opportunity** | Good `history_score`, low `dpd`          | Upsell, build loyalty | Credit upgrades, personalized loans |
| **Stable**           | Middle-ground SHAP impact                | Improve engagement    | Nudges, score-based education       |
